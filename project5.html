            <h3>About This Project</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project is a project that I did for fun. I did this project when I was learning about Game Development using unity.
                This is a 2D RogueLike-TopDownShooter Game where the player need to talk to do the quests, and beat monsters, open chests to earn
                good gears. But, if the player dies, the game will restart from the very begining. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Each character in this game has different ability, there is a character that can summon pets,
                a character that has invinsibility, a character that can run fast, and a character who can throw toxic potion, and a
                character that can stop time. The main objective of this game is to eradicate the dark forces, which is corrupting the universe.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Doing this project was really fun. This is certainly not my first time creating a game in unity, but it was my first time
                making a 2D RogueLike-TopDownShooter Game using Unity Engine and C# programming language. So, it was a new experience for me.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first thing I learned in this project is about PlayerPrefs (Unity's local save) system. I learned this thing because I 
                find it important to save the player's progress in the game. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The next thing I learned in this project is Random tilemap generation. This system is needed in order to create
                that randomness in every Level of the game.
