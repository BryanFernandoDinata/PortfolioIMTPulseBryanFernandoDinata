            <h3>About This Project</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project is a project that I did for fun. I did this project when I was learning about Game Development using unity.
                This is a 2D Platformer Game where the player need to talk to the NPC(Non-Player-Characters), do the quests, and beat monsters
                to earn money to get better gears. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Each character in this game has different ability, there is a character that can summon turret,
                a character that has super jump, a character that can run fast, and a character who can throw molotov cocktail. The main objective of 
                this game is to eradicate space hives, which is corrupting the universe.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Doing this project was really fun. This is certainly not my first time creating a game in unity, but it was my first time
                making a 2D Platformer Game using Unity Engine and C# programming language. So, it was a new experience for me.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first thing I learned in this project is about GPGS (Google Play Games Save) system. I learned this thing because I 
                find it important when I want to publish this game in the goolge play store in the future. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Instead of using regular save 
                system like playerprefs and local save system I decided to use cloud save system which is GPGS. This system is very usefull 
                for checking the latest game version, modifying files from cloud even though the game is already uploaded, and auto-updates. 
                Not only that, but this system also prevents the player from hacking the Game.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The second thing I learned in this project is about Monetizing. Monetizing is something that is really important for a Game Developer. 
                This is because if a Game Developer does not monetize the game, that Game Developer will not earn money from the game. In this project, I 
                learned to Implement In-App-Purchase system and Ads system.
