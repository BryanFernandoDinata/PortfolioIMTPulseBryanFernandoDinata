            <h3>About This Project</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project is an Extracurricular game Project. I did this project when I was learning about Game Development using Construct Game Engine.
                This is a 2D TopDown Game where the player need to dodge obstacles, collect coins, and reach the end destination
                in order to win the game. The other reason why I did this project is to get a good mark in my Extraccuricular.
            </p>

                Doing this project was really fun. This is certainly not my first time Game Developing, but it was my first time
                making a 2D TopDown Game using Construct Game Engine. So, it was a new experience for me.
